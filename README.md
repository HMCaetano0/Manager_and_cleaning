# Shortcut-Manager-v2
Hello, I come to share my tool to group Desktop shortcuts within 1 program. It's an old program, the code is kind of confusing and messy (Gambs lol), but I'll post the Source Code.

Functions:
-Store shortcuts in a single environment
-Separate Game Applications
-Sort alphabetically
-Search bar to find the fastest program
-Go to folder the file
-Delete unnecessary files from Temp and others
-Check the integrity of the file (if it has been altered or corrupted)
-Define your primary language
